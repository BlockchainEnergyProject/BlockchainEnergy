Blockchainenergy Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

Blockchain energy is a globally distributed decentralized organization without a central governing company, 
despite the fact that it was created by a renewable energy company. 
There is no head office, no CEOs or CFOs. It is supported by the community.
This coin is issued for the creation of passive income by users regardless of the company and so that everyone 
could bring an idea to the company development. We plan to use it as an alternative fee for electricity generated 
by our company.
